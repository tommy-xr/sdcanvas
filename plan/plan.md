- Fix CI issues and add badge
- Add screenshot of app in action in simulation on main page
- Add link to sdcanvas.dev from README on GitHub
- Non-HTTP transport modelling (websocket, raw tcp, udp, other)
- API - model cache-through behavior against db (ie, check redis first)
- Simulation:
  - [x] Round-trip visualization - requests (green) travel forward, responses (blue) trace back to user. User nodes show RTT and success rate
  - [x] Error animation - red dots float upward and fade out when requests are dropped (see `plan/completed/simulate-overload.md`)
  - [x] Simulation controls (play/stop/pause) - implemented in bottom status bar simulation control panel
  - Show auto-scale behavior  - show the current number of instances. Pulse when scaling up/down. We should differentiate when auto-scaling without a load-balancer (where the api server would be continually hit).
  - Show estimated cost of running nodes. This should impact, for example, the COGs
  - For stats, give indication that they are averaged across the instance count
  - For nodes, give the option for specific node hardware types (memory, cpu) to give more fidelity to scaling and cost.
  - Allow per-node `maxRpsOverride` in canvas file (currently hardcoded per node type in `nodeBehaviors.ts`)
- How can we gamify this? It would be fun to see, for example, how low we can make the cost and preserve 3 9s reliability
- Simulation capability - see [simulation.md](./simulation.md) for detailed plan
- Undo/redo as first 'baby step'
- GPT integration (BYOK)
    - AI Review
    - Initial set of sample problems
- SaaS: Ability to load/save into cloud
- SaaS: Ability to collaborate / invite
- Lower pane (practice problemsevaluation, errors)
	- Leetcode for SD
- Test out database problem / optimization
- [ ] Simulation: Phase 4: 3D visualization with pylons
- [x] Testing: Add accessibility handles to edges for Playwright testability
- [x] Testing: CLI simulation validation (`npm run test:simulate`) - validates success rates for sim-*.json files

- Cut:
	- Fusion 360 style timeline view, not on the critical path or needed here
