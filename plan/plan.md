- Non-HTTP transport modelling (websocket, raw tcp, udp, other)
- API - model cache-through behavior against db (ie, check redis first)
- Simulation: 
  - We should be showing the "round-trip" behavior of API requests through the system. The latency for the client should show the average round-trip latency & error rate / dropped requests
  - There should be an animation for when 'dots' are dropped / errored out (like an evaporating red dot)
  - The UI should show the 'play' / 'stop' pause in header, but the details as a sub-header in the canvas area
  - Show auto-scale behavior  - show the current number of instances. Pulse when scaling up/down
  - Show estimated cost of running nodes. This should impact, for example, the COGs
  - For stats, give indication that they are averaged across the instance count
  - For nodes, give the option for specific node hardware types (memory, cpu) to give more fidelity to scaling and cost.
- How can we gamify this? It would be fun to see, for example, how low we can make the cost and preserve 3 9s reliability
- Simulation capability - see [simulation.md](./simulation.md) for detailed plan
