- Non-HTTP transport modelling (websocket, raw tcp, udp, other)
- API - model cache-through behavior against db (ie, check redis first)
- Simulation: 
  - [x] Round-trip visualization - requests (green) travel forward, responses (blue) trace back to user. User nodes show RTT and success rate
  - There should be an animation for when 'dots' are dropped / errored out (like an evaporating red dot)
  - [x] Simulation controls (play/stop/pause) - implemented in bottom status bar simulation control panel
  - Show auto-scale behavior  - show the current number of instances. Pulse when scaling up/down
  - Show estimated cost of running nodes. This should impact, for example, the COGs
  - For stats, give indication that they are averaged across the instance count
  - For nodes, give the option for specific node hardware types (memory, cpu) to give more fidelity to scaling and cost.
- How can we gamify this? It would be fun to see, for example, how low we can make the cost and preserve 3 9s reliability
- Simulation capability - see [simulation.md](./simulation.md) for detailed plan
- Ability to branch - fusion 360 timeline view
    - Undo/redo as first 'baby step'
- GPT integration (BYOK)
    - AI Review
    - Initial set of sample problems
- SaaS: Ability to load/save into cloud
- SaaS: Ability to collaborate / invite
- Lower pane (practice problemsevaluation, errors)
