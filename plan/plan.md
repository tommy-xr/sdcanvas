- Export / load JSON
    - Consider back-compat (version in JSON, versioned loaders + upgraders)
    - Testing, API / core sim + model library split out and independent of UI
- Non-HTTP transport (websocket, raw tcp, udp, other)
- Delete key issues?
- API - model cache-through behavior against db (ie, check redis first)
- Lower pane (evaluation, errors)
- Simulation capability
- Simulation: Transition to '3d' view with pylons for stats
- Simulation: Show monitoring (newrelic, etc) style graphs of CPU, RPS, etc
- Data Model Redesign
- Ability to branch - fusion 360 timeline view
    - Undo/redo as first 'baby step'
- Non-local
- GPT integration (BYOK)
    - AI Review
- Leetcode for SD
    - Initial set of sample problems
